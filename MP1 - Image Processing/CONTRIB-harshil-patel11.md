Additional Comments:
-
- All team members were present during the team meetings/calls where we discussed ideas and ways to develop algorithms.
- All team members played an integral role in the development of this MP.
- The (Assisted) keyword above signifies that one or more teammates were also present during the implementation of specified method/test.
- On many occassions, teammates used screensharing to write code together and then commited/pushed files. These also signify the methods with the "Assisted" keyword. 
- All team members made specifications for each of their methods.
- Finally, each member can vouch that our tasks for this MP were done in accordance with the Academic Integrity Policies for CPEN 221.
