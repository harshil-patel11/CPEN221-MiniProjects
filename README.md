# CPEN221-MiniProjects
- Mini-Projects for CPEN 221 - Principles of Software Construction at The University of British Columbia
- Collaborators include my teammates for the course - Mark Mekhail and Ritam Singal
- These were a series of Mini Projects that we did over the course in order to get a better understanding in topics like Image Processing, Data Structures, Concurrency, and Socket Programming (and Testing) using Java
- For each of the MPs, there is a README.md file attached showing what was expected from us.
