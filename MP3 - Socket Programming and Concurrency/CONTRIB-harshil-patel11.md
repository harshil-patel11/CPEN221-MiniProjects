Additional Comments:
-
- All team members were present during the team meetings/calls where we discussed ideas and ways to develop algorithms.
- All team members played an integral role in the development of this MP.
- On most occassions, teammates used the CodeWithMe (live editing) extension to write code together and then the host commited/pushed files (usually only 1 person pushed the code worked on by everyone).
- All team members made specifications and wrote rep invariants / abstraction functions for equal number of methods.
- Finally, each member can vouch that our tasks for this MP were done in accordance with the Academic Integrity Policies for CPEN 221.
